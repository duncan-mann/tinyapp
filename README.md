*Registration Page* üîë

After creating an account and logging in, you will be redirected to the home page. If it's your first time, there won't be any links. But once you have added some it will look like this!

*Tiny URL Home Page* üè†

From here you can see your long and short URLs, and the date at which they were added. You can also edit or delete each URL. To add a new URL, click the create new URL button on the navigation bar.
